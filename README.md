# Employee Segmentation using PCA and K-Means

This project segments employees based on training motivations using PCA and K-Means clustering. The goal is to support personalized learning strategies by identifying distinct employee groups at Nexus Logistics Solutions.

## 📌 Objective
Reduce dimensionality from survey data and group employees into clusters reflecting career ambitions, learning preferences, and engagement levels.

## 🧠 Methods Used
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means Clustering
- Cluster Profiling
- Visualization of PC scores and cluster traits

## 🛠 Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Excel

## 🧩 Clusters Identified
- **Career-Driven** – Ambitious, growth-focused  
- **Stability-Oriented** – Consistent, risk-averse  
- **Explorative** – Curious, eager to upskill  
- **Unengaged** – Low motivation, limited participation

## 📊 Impact
The segmentation guided targeted training plans aligned with employee mindsets and improved overall program engagement across locations.
